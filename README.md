# Overview
## What is MultiThreading?
================================
Multithreading is a model of program execution that allows for multiple threads to be created within a process, executing independently but concurrently sharing process resources. Depending on the hardware, threads can run fully parallel if they are distributed to their own CPU core.

# Implement MultiThreading In Car Rental System

Car Rental System is based on the concept to rent cars and generate rental invoices for a rental company. The main functionality in every module has a separate thread. When a function runs, a thread is created and when the function finishes its working, thread is terminated. You can get the thread pid in every module as well.
